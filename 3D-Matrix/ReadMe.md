# 3D Matrix

A 3D engine powered by matricies. Currently supports Love2D and the Silica Emulator.

## Features
 - Efficient matrix implementation
 - Code generation for lines and triangles allowing powerful custom shaders
 - Code generation for buffers, supporting depth testing and alpha blending

## Roadmap
 - Fix near z plane clipping
 - Add support for stencil buffer, and custom buffer read/write modes (read only, write only, read&write, ignore)
 - Back face culling
